# System Requirements

## 1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose 
The objective of this documentation is to demonstrate the systems software requirements, user interaction, and detailed overview of the AirBnB clone project. After reading this SRS document it is anticipated that the features and functionalities are clearly understood and the further design work is based on it. This documentation will serve as the basis and reference for the design and development process in the future and will be changed when necessary, it will be the foundation for communication within the development team and also stakeholders. 

1.2 Scope 
This project will be focused on backend development of the AirBnB clone which is a web application with core functionality scope:
- It will enable the user to book and list properties for rent
- It will enable users to search and filter properties based on thier liking
- It will enable users to pay using different payment methods
- It will provide a powerful admin dashboard to make user experience smooth


1.3 Overview 
As previously stated above, the purpose of the documenation is to provide readers with enough information about the project structure, core functional and non-functional requirements supported with different UML diagrams and textual expalnations.
This document outlines the functional and technical requirements for the backend system of an Airbnb-style property rental platform. The system is designed to support core features such as user authentication, property listing and management, booking workflows, secure payment handling, messaging between users, and review submissions.

The platform serves three primary user roles: guests, hosts, and administrators, each with specific capabilities and permissions. Guests can browse available properties, make bookings, submit reviews, and communicate with hosts. Hosts can list and manage properties, respond to booking requests, and interact with guests. Administrators oversee the system, manage user access, and handle disputes or platform-level tasks.

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the database schema, key backend processes (including a visual flowchart), API requirements, and business logic constraints. The goal is to ensure a consistent, secure, and scalable backend architecture that supports both current functionality and future enhancements.
